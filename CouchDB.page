# Views

Views are a good tool for querying a database.

**Permanent Views** are stored in the database as `/db/_design/ddoc`.

**Temporary Views** are not stored in the database.  These are useful for development.

## Map Functions

Views are defined by functions that *map view keys to values*.  The structure of a view function is this:

```javascript
function (doc) {
  emit(<key>, <value>);
}
```

This is the most simple example:

```javascript
function (doc) {
  emit(doc._id, doc);
}
```

**Filters**

You can use *if statements* to filter results based on a certain field.  Commonly this is used with a *type* field on the object.

```javascript
function (doc) {
  if (doc.type == "<type>") {
    emit(doc._id, doc);
  }
}
```

**Indices**

Commonly you want to query data based on the values in arbitrary fields rather than just the id.  The *index* field to you pass to *emit* can be used for this purpose.

```javascript
function (doc) {
  emit(<field>, doc);
}
```

```javascript
function (doc) {
  emit(doc.firstName+" "+doc.lastName, doc);
}
```
