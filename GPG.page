# GPG

GPG is a common, open-source PGP implementation.

## Generating a keypair

The following commands will create a new key and revocation certificate.  You'll need to keep your revocation certificate secure so that you can invalidate your key if it is ever compromised.

```bash
$ gpg --gen-key
$ gpg --gen-revoke --armor --output=<filename>.asc <email>
```

## Importing a Public Key

In order to communicate with someone else, you'll need to know their public key.  There are a few ways to import this.

*Import from a file*

```bash
$ gpg --import <filename>
```

*Import from a key server*

```bash
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --search-keys <email>
```

```bash
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <fingerprint>
```
