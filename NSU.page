# Bisha Mine

Bisha is a high-grade volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit in Eritrea.  The mine was constructed between 2008 and 2010.  The mine produced gold-silver dor√© until 2013, when it was converted into a copper mine.  In June 2016, the mine began producing Zinc as well.

According to the company, Bisha remains largely unexplored and has strong potential for discovery of additional mineral deposits.
